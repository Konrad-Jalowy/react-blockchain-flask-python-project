# react-blockchain-flask-python-project
Blockchain React-Flask-Python project I completed with the Udemy course </br>
# Important info: </br>
- These are the project I completed with Udemy courses some time ago and now I revisit the code and document my portfolio. </br>
- This project deals with Python and blockchain. I do not search for a job as Python developer, but that being said, I spent some time in Python
and I can definitely understand simple api written in Flask </br>
- I did this project some time ago. I do not search job as a blockchain expert and could definitely revisit the course to master the blockchain part of
the app. Main reason I upload this course project is the fact that recently I came back to it to finish the frontend that is made in React </br>
- There are two main advantages of this project I want to point out: </br>
  - It invloves frotned written in hook-based React </br>
  - It involves the idea of bundling together the core of the app (written in Python), the backend framework (Flask) and the frontend framework or rather
  frontend library to be totally precise (React) </br>

# Strengths: </br>
- Deals with blockchain which isnt typical abstract data type. You can feel author is confident in his abilities in that area </br>
- Pretty well-written clean code </br>
- Author uses tests </br>
- Well-documented and well-structured </br>
- Challenging project </br>
- React-based frontend bundled together with core of the app written in Python and minimalistic Flask-based api </br>
- Believe it or not, I did not know about React bootstrap library. </br>
- Uses hooks, React router </br>
- Uses constants with api base url, both in Python and React </br>
- I also love fetch API instead of all other possible ways to create xhr :) </br>
- Uses .env in the backend </br>

# Weaknesses: </br>
- Using TypeScript in frontend React part wouldnt hurt, especially that the whole project is very pedantic and very clear while being minimalistic </br>
- Could introduce some library for conditional structures in JSX </br>
- Uses .js extension instead of .jsx. Proper extensions help code editor </br>
- only useState and useEffect, nothing too fancy </br>
- Url fetched is string with search params interpolated. There are JS built-in classes everyone should know: URL and URLSearchParams class </br>
- I dont know about using clg or alert... </br>
- Introduced the idea of bundling together flask-based backend api and react-based frontend but the way I see it the cors was set up using a wildcard which
might not be the best idea. I mean, origins was clearly specified to be React app but the whole app was exposed to it using wildcard. 
I just feel in could be more specific, just have this red alert in my head seeing a wildcard :) </br>
- Aside from being well-written, well-structured and clean, it looks like the author really knows what hes doing but still kinda like copies basic cors setup
from the documentation, uses the basic flask features like app.route decorator or jsonify. I know, main focus is on the blockchain itself and the whole app
is well-written, but still... </br>
- All in all, great project Im happy to complete, but I came to it more to try out react frontend with some backend app rather than for the same app, since
Im not looking for a job as Python developer </br>
